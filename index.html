<p>The recorded demo below runs the GA on one randomly-seeded value. The GA was parallelized for multiple randomly-seeded values, so its output for more than one run has little meaning.</p>
<p>The GA outputs the seed index, the generation, and the calculated minimum, average, and maximum fitness values for the generation.</p>
<p>Once a GA run is complete, a CSV file is generated to output the metrics and reels for the best individual, as shown in the Excel UI in the demo. </p>
